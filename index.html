                        <p>The enemies UI in the game needed to convey to the player how much damage the player was gonna deal to the enemy, what kind of debuffs the cards had applied to the enemy as well as showing what action the enemy intends on doing this round. All of this had to be done without cluttering up the game space too much around the enemies as well as not confusing the players as we didn't want them to read a long text about what the UI means to understand it</p>

                        <h3>Enemies</h3>
                        <p>The enemies in the game all have different attack preferences and reactions for what happens on the board, some will only attack while other enemies are alive, while some will always try to buff their fellow enemies unless they are alone on the board. We also made the enemies use new and more actions after having killed the final boss to make the game more fun to keep playing and also more challenging.</p>
