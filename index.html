                        <p>For this project I worked as Team Lead, Game Designer and Programmer. As Programmer I made the Crafting and Repair system, as well as doing the Fmod integration for our project. Other than that I did a lot of bug fixing for both mine and others code.</p>

                            <h3>Fmod Integration</h3>
                            <p>For this project I tasked myself with integrating Fmod to give our game a better soundscape. I wanted to integrate it in a way that would allow the other programmers to easily play sounds of all types through just one Method call. To do this I made a SoundManager that allows anyone to call a method passing an Fmod event reference and an enum for what type of sound it is. When the method is called the SoundManager takes care of the sound instancing and keeps references for the sounds played to lessen loading times for sounds that would be replayed later through storing them in a dictionary using the GameObject and Fmod event reference as a key, doing it this way also allowed for several objects to play the same sounds.</p>
                            <p>I also made saving functionality for the sound settings using a binary formatter. I would save the volume profile for each sound bank for Fmod and save that to a file, as well as saving a version file to make sure the right saving format was used to avoid issues when updating the games settings file format.</p>

                            <p>I also made the Workstations for the game. They were made using a Base workstation script that has most of the functionality needed to make the different types of workstations in the game. I then used the workstation base script to make the other workstations in the game. The workstations also contain code for feedback telling the player if items are being repaired/crafted and if the player is close enough to place items on the station. I also modified other scripts that had anything to do with player interaction and added code to show feedback to the players in order to guide them around the level.</p>

As programmer I was mainly tasked with overhauling and expanding on the games enemy AI and making tools for the designer to more efficiently make new enemies.

                            <p>The enemy AI in the game was originally very simple and only had a few different actions it could take, I expanded on this by making the enemies actions and ai a lot more customizable by giving them more actions they can do, and by allowing for modifications that can be done using conditions to modify their behaviors and what they can and cannot do. This then changes up the enmies available actions depending on conditions like, what other enemies are on the board with them, wether or not the player had already beaten the game before, is the enemy low on health and a lot of other conditions</p>

                            <p>To make the enemy AI a lot more easily customizable I decided to create a tool for the game designer to use when creating new enemies for the game. This tool allowed the designer to decide what conditions had to pass before an enemy could consider doing an action, then it would choose an action from all the possible actions depending on action priority and weight. All the conditions could also be used to modify other aspects of the enemies decision making, like modifying an actions likelyhood of happening by changing the weight of an action under certain circumstances, or even changing an actions strength value. There are also descriptive tooltips for all aspects of the tool to help the designers understand how it works</p>

                            <p>The conditions for an enemies action would be checked through a separate class called the condition checker to see if all the actions conditions are met.

Alternatly conditions can be checked with an array of conditions which is useful for other cases, like in our game where the conditions are also used to check if any action strength or weight modifications should be made.</p>

                            <p>The enemies UI in the game needed to convey to the player how much damage the player was gonna deal to the enemy, what kind of debuffs the cards had applied to the enemy as well as showing what action the enemy intends on doing this round. All of this had to be done without cluttering up the game space too much around the enemies as well as not confusing the players as we didn't want them to read a long text about what the UI means to understand it</p>

                            <h3>Enemies</h3>
                            <p>The enemies in the game all have different attack preferences and reactions for what happens on the board, some will only attack while other enemies are alive, while some will always try to buff their fellow enemies unless they are alone on the board. We also made the enemies use new and more actions after having killed the final boss to make the game more fun to keep playing and also more challenging.</p>
